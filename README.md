## `Retail Price Optimization`

**AIM**

- The objective is to predict future daily sales for thousands of stores based on historical data. Predictive models attempt at forecasting future sales based on historical data while taking into account seasonality effects, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition. For instance black Friday sales go crazy so the model has to take into effect all these scenarios.

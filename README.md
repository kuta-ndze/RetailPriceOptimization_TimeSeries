## `Retail Price Optimization`

**AIM**

- The objective is to predict future daily sales for thousands of stores based on historical data. Predictive models attempt at forecasting future sales based on historical data while taking into account seasonality effects, demand, holidays, promotions, and competition. For instance black Friday sales go crazy so the model has to take into effect all these scenarios.

**Methodology**

- `Exploratory Data Analysis`
  EDA is the process of analyzing the data set to understand its characteristics. In this case:
  - Number of closed, open stores, competition distance etc
  - Are they any NAN?
  - Find outliers
  - Check for duplicate values
  - Correlations
